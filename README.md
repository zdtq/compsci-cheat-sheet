# Cheat Sheet for *Algoritmi e Principi dell'Informatica* @ PoliMi

This cheat sheet is designed for the course [*Algoritmi e Principi dell'Informatica*](https://onlineservices.polimi.it/manifesti/manifesti/controller/ManifestoPublic.do?EVN_DETTAGLIO_RIGA_MANIFESTO=evento&aa=2023&k_cf=225&k_corso_la=358&k_indir=I3I&codDescr=086067&lang=IT&semestre=2&idGruppo=4750&idRiga=296961) at Politecnico di Milano. The course combines key topics from **Theoretical Computer Science** (TCS) and **Data Structures & Algorithms** (DSA).

This document serves as a quick reference for essential concepts, definitions, and problem-solving techniques covered throughout the course.

**Format**: Optimized for printing on two regular A4 pages (front and back). Select 'Landscape' orientation when printing.
